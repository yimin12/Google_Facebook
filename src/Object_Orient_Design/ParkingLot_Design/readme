n levels, each level has m rows of spots and each row has k spots.So each level has m x k spots.
The parking lot can park motorcycles, cars and buses
The parking lot has motorcycle spots, compact spots, and large spots
Each row, motorcycle spots id is in range [0,k/4)(0 is included, k/4 is not included), compact spots id is in range [k/4,k/4*3)(k/4*3 is not included) and large spots id is in range [k/4*3,k)(k is not included).
A motorcycle can park in any spot
A car park in single compact spot or large spot
A bus can park in five large spots that are consecutive and within same row. it can not park in small spots

Example
Example 1

Input:
level=1
num_rows=1
spots_per_row=11
parkVehicle("Motorcycle_1")
parkVehicle("Car_1")
parkVehicle("Car_2")
parkVehicle("Car_3")
parkVehicle("Car_4")
parkVehicle("Car_5")
parkVehicle("Bus_1")
unParkVehicle("Car_5")
parkVehicle("Bus_1")

Output:

Explanation:
Parking Lotï¼š
Motorcycle: 0 1
Car:        2 3 4 5
Bus:        6 7 8 9 10
When "Car_5" first got to the parking lot, there is no place for it in compact spots.
The "Car_5" has to park in Bus spot 6. So "Bus_1" cannot park until "Car_5" left.
Example 2

Input:
level=1
num_rows=1
spots_per_row=14
parkVehicle("Motorcycle_1")
parkVehicle("Motorcycle_2")
parkVehicle("Motorcycle_3")
parkVehicle("Car_1")
parkVehicle("Car_2")
parkVehicle("Car_3")
parkVehicle("Motorcycle_4")
parkVehicle("Car_4")
parkVehicle("Car_5")
parkVehicle("Car_6")
parkVehicle("Car_7")
parkVehicle("Bus_1")
unParkVehicle("Car_1")
unParkVehicle("Motorcycle_4")
unParkVehicle("Car_3")
unParkVehicle("Car_6")
parkVehicle("Bus_1")
unParkVehicle("Car_7")
parkVehicle("Bus_1")
