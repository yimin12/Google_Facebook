 *   @Description :
 *      You have a total of n thousand yuan, hoping to apply for a university abroad. The application is required to pay a certain fee.
 *       Give the cost of each university application and the probability of getting the University's offer, and the number of university is
 *      m. If the economy allows, you can apply for multiple universities. Find the highest probability of receiving at least one offer.
 *      Example 1:
	    Input:
                n = 10
                prices = [4,4,5]
                probability = [0.1,0.2,0.3]
            Output:  0.440

            Explanationï¼š
            select the second and the third school.


        Example 2:
            Input:
                n = 10
                prices = [4,5,6]
                probability = [0.1,0.2,0.3]
            Output:  0.370

            Explanation:
            select the first and the third school.
